# Pinecone Integration
Integrate Pinecone, a powerful vector database, with LangChain to efficiently manage and retrieve context data. This integration enables seamless storage and retrieval of file-based context, enhancing AI responses with greater personalization and accuracy.

**Objectives**
  1. Manage context data: Utilize the TextLoader to load text data from files and transform this data into embeddings using OpenAI's models before storing it in Pinecone.
  2. Integrate Pinecone with LangChain: Connect Pinecone with LangChain to enhance your AI applications, allowing them to query context efficiently and dynamically during interactions.
  3. Implement vector storage: Understand how to store context data as vectors in Pinecone, which can be used to fetch relevant information based on the AIâ€™s needs.

**How to Complete the Template**

**Step 1:** Configure Pinecone

First, set up the Pinecone client using your API key and initialize the Pinecone index where your data will be stored. For this example, we will use "quickstart" as the default index name (as referenced in Pinecone's documentation).

ðŸ“Œ Note: You can replace "quickstart" with a unique and meaningful index name for your application. Ensure that the index name matches the one created in the Pinecone dashboard.

**Initialize Pinecone Client and Index**

const pinecone = new Pinecone({
  apiKey: process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY as string,
});

const pineconeIndex = pinecone.Index("quickstart");

**Step 2:** Load Context from a File

Create a function to extract documents from a file to be used as context for embedding. The text data will be transformed into embeddings before being stored in Pinecone.

**How it Works:**
1. Use TextLoader to read text from a file.
2. Convert the text into Document objects.
3. Store metadata for additional context or identification.

**Load Documents from a File**

// Create docs with a loader from a file
async function createDocs(filePath: string): Document[] {
  const loader = new TextLoader(filePath);
  return await loader.load();
}

**Step 3:** Embed and Store Data in Pinecone
To store context data efficiently:
1. Set up the embedding model using OpenAI.
2. Generate embeddings for the documents.
3. Store the embeddings in Pinecone for future retrieval.
   
**Define the Embedding Model**

// Get the embeddings model 
function getEmbeddingModel() {
  return new OpenAIEmbeddings({
    model: "text-embedding-3-large",
    apiKey: process.env.OPEN_AI_KEY,
  });
}

**Store Embeddings in Pinecone**

// Store embeddings in Pinecone
async function storeEmbeddings() {
  const docs = await createDocs("./context/client.txt");
  const embeddings = getEmbeddingModel();
  
  await PineconeStore.fromDocuments(docs, embeddings, {
    pineconeIndex,
    maxConcurrency: 5, // Maximum number of concurrent batch requests (each batch contains 1000 vectors)
  });
}

Conclusion
By following this template, you can successfully integrate Pinecone with LangChain to enhance AI models with context-aware responses. This setup ensures efficient storage, retrieval, and utilization of vector-based context data, making AI interactions more relevant and personalized.

Happy Coding!
